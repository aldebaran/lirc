    <P>
      The following description was written having receivers in mind
      that deliver IR signals as pulses and spaces. So some of this
      will not be relevant for receivers that work at a higher
      abstraction layer as <NOBR>e.g.</NOBR> the Irman or TV card
      receivers.
    </P>
    
    <P>
      There already is a growing database of config files for remote
      controls available at the LIRC homepage. But if your remote
      control is not available yet you can use <em>irrecord</em> to
      create a config file for your remote control.  If you want to
      use more than one remote control you have to create a separate
      file for each remote. If your remote control is able to control
      different devices it is often wise to create separate config
      files for each functional unit of the remote control.  You can
      later use a single config file for <em>lircd</em> by simply
      merging the config files with <NOBR><em>cat config1 config2
      &gt;lircd.conf</em></NOBR>.
    </P>
    
    <P>
      Before using <em>irrecord</em> you should start <em>mode2</em>
      and have a look at the signals that your receiver supplies. If
      you can see random pulses without pushing any buttons of your
      remote control your receiver is picking up ambient light. So if
      your receiver has no ambient light filter try to add one. A good
      strategy might also be to create a config file in a dark room
      and to turn off all fluorescent lamps or any other devices that
      may cause IR noise.
    </P>
    
    <P>
      If decoding of IR commands does not work reliably you can try to
      modify the <em>eps</em> and <em>aeps</em> values in the lircd
      config file to adjust the tolerance of signal
      lengths. <em>aeps</em> is an absolute value while <em>eps</em>
      is a relative value expressed in percent. Also if repeats do not
      work you should complain. I.e. if you hold down a button the
      output of <em>irw</em> should look like this.

      Note how the second field gets incremented. Many people don't
      even notice if this does not work correctly.

    <P>
      If you want to use a config file to send IR commands you should
      try to vary the modulation frequency of the signals. The default
      frequency is <NOBR>38000 Hz</NOBR>. It cannot be detected
      automatically because the receiver hardware only gives us the
      demodulated signals. Using the correct modulation frequency will
      increase range significantly. You can set the modulation
      frequency for a remote control by adding the line
    <PRE>
        frequency &lt;freq&gt;</PRE>
    <P>
      to the according section of the config file where <em>freq</em>
      stands for the modulation frequency in Hertz. Usually values
      from 34000 to 44000 are good choices.
    </P>
    
    <P>
      As creating new config files is difficult sometimes and irrecord
      often cannot detect all features of the remote control please
      send new config files to <A
      HREF="mailto:lirc@bartelmus.de">lirc@bartelmus.de</A>. Other
      people will appreciate this very much. Sometimes they cannot
      create such a config file themselves because their original
      remote control is broken or has been lost. Some devices that are
      capable of IR come without a remote control. Some people also
      only want to build a transmitter and if you make a config file
      available for them they won't need to build a receiver,
      too. Please add all information you can get concerning the
      remote control as a comment to the config file.
    </P>
    
    <P>
      If you still have difficulties to create a working config file
      send the following information to <A
      HREF="mailto:lirc@bartelmus.de">lirc@bartelmus.de</A>:
