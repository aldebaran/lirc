		    <P>
		      With lirc 0.8.5 and earlier, iMON device support is a bit
		      lacking in feature-completeness, compared with Windows,
		      and for the newer devices, a pain for users to set up.
		    </P>

		    <P>
		      First up, many devices still need HID quirk overrides to
		      prevent the usbhid driver from claiming them before lirc
		      can. For starters, you need to determine the USB Vendor
		      and Device ID for you iMON device. Most devices have a
		      Vendor ID of 0x15c2. Device IDs are typically either
		      0xffdc or somewhere in the 0x0030 through 0x0046 range.
		      You should be able to see your IDs in the output of the
		      command 'lsusb'. For the purposes of this example, we'll
		      assume you have the 15c2:0045 device.
		    </P>

		    <P>
		      If your kernel has usbhid built as a module, then
		      the following in a modprobe config file (such as
		      /etc/modprobe.d/imon.conf) might be necessary:
		      <pre>
options usbhid quirks=0x15c2:0x0045:0x0004
		      </pre>

		      If your kernel has usbhid built-in, you may need to add
		      the quirk info to the your kernel boot parameters, like
		      so:
		      <pre>
usbhid.quirks=0x15c2:0x0045:0x4
		      </pre>

		      If you're lucky, your device has already been quirked
		      properly in the usbhid driver itself, but if not, please
		      let the lirc developers know, so they can submit patches
		      to the usbhid driver upstream. You can tell if its
		      necessary by grepping your dmesg output after booting up,
		      looking for USB HID and your Device ID, like so:
		      <pre>
$ dmesg |grep "USB HID.*15c2"
input,hidraw0: USB HID v1.01 Mouse [HID 15c2:0045] on usb-0000:00:02.0-2
hiddev96hidraw1: USB HID v1.00 Device [HID 15c2:0045] on usb-0000:00:02.0-2
		      </pre>

		      In the above, we can see that the usbhid driver has claimed
		      our iMON device, and manual quirk addition is required.

		    </P>

		    <P>
		      Newer devices have two USB IR endpoints, which lead to
		      lirc 0.8.5 and earlier setting up two lirc devices for
		      what was in fact a single device, and the two devices
		      had to be bound together in userspace, lest the input
		      buffer would get wedged if a button from the device
		      you weren't listening to wasn't serviced. So if you're
		      using lirc 0.8.5 or earlier, you'll need to start up
		      two lircd daemons, bound to one another, along these
		      lines:
		      <pre>
lircd --driver=default --device=/dev/lirc0 --pidfile=/var/run/lirc0.pid --listen=8765
lircd --driver=default --device=/dev/lirc1 --pidfile=/var/run/lirc1.pid --output=/dev/lircd --connect=localhost:8765
		      </pre>

		        Note that this requires some modification of
			distribution-provided init scripts, manual startup or
			what have you, in most cases. It really does work
			though...

		    </P>

		    <P>
		      With post-0.8.5 lirc, the dual interface iMON devices
		      are handled as a single lirc device, greatly
		      simplifying setup for users -- distribution init
		      scripts should work out of the box. However, it may
		      still be necessary to manually add a quirk to keep
		      the usbhid driver from claiming your device.
		    </P>

		    <P>
		      In addition, post-0.8.5 lirc now includes mouse input
		      device support, so the keyboard/mouse toggle button
		      actually functions as one would expect it to (and as
		      it does under Windows). A special bonus not present
		      under Windows (I think) is that the ch+/- buttons
		      emulate a scroll wheel in mouse mode.
		    </P>

		    <P>
		      A lot of credit is due to Ron Frazier, for documenting
		      the necessary config for lirc 0.8.5 and earlier with
		      the newer iMON devices. See <a href="http://mythtvblog.blogspot.com/2008/04/getting-imon-0038-lcd-working-with-lirc.html" target="_blank">http://mythtvblog.blogspot.com/2008/04/getting-imon-0038-lcd-working-with-lirc.html</a>
		      for historical reference.
		    </P>
