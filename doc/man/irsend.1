.SH NAME
irsend - basic LIRC program to send infra-red commands
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B irsend
[\fIoptions\fR] \fIDIRECTIVE REMOTE CODE \fR[\fICODE\fR...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Asks the \fBlircd\fR daemon to send one or more CIR
(Consumer Infra-Red) commands. This is intended for remote control
of electronic devices such as TV boxes, HiFi sets, etc.
.PP
\fIDIRECTIVE\fR can be:
.nf
.RS 3
\fBSEND_ONCE\fR         - send \fICODE\fR [\fICODE\fR ...] once
\fBSEND_START\fR        - start repeating \fICODE\fR
\fBSEND_STOP\fR         - stop repeating \fICODE\fR
\fBLIST\fR              - list configured remote items
\fBSET_TRANSMITTERS\fR  - set transmitters \fINUM\fR [\fINUM\fR ...]
\fBSIMULATE\fR          - simulate IR event
.RE
.fi

.PP 
\fIREMOTE\fR is the name of a remote, as described in the \fBlircd\fR
configuration file.

.PP
\fICODE\fR is the name of a remote control key of \fIREMOTE\fR, as it
appears in the \fBlircd\fR configuration file.

.PP
\fINUM\fR is the transmitter number of the hardware device. 

.PP
For the \fBLIST\fR \fIDIRECTIVE\fR, \fIREMOTE\fR and/or \fICODE\fR
can be empty:

.nf
.RS 3
\fBLIST\fR   ""    ""   - list all configured remote names
\fBLIST\fR \fIREMOTE\fR  ""   - list all codes of \fIREMOTE\fR
\fBLIST\fR \fIREMOTE\fR \fICODE\fR  - list only \fICODE\fR of \fIREMOTE\fR
.RE
.fi

.PP
The \fBSIMULATE\fR command only works if it has been explicitly
enabled in lircd.

.SH FILES
.TP
.I /etc/lirc/lircd.conf
Default \fBlircd\fR configuration file.  It should contain all the
remotes, their infra-red codes and the corresponding timing and 
waveform details.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
If \fBlircd\fR is not running (or /var/run/lirc/lircd lacks write
permissions) \fBirsend\fR aborts with the following diagnostics:
.nf
"irsend: could not connect to socket"
"irsend: Connection refused" (or "Permission denied").
