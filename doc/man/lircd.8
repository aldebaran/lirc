.SH NAME
lircd - LIRC daemon decodes infrared signals and provides them on a Unix
domain socket.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lircd
[\fIoptions\fR] [\fIconfig-file\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The main task of lircd is to decode the infrared signals and provide
an uniform interface for client applications. Clients can connect to
lircd through a Unix domain socket which is located in
\/var/run/lirc/lircd.  Using this ocket they will get the infrared
codes received by lircd and they can send commands to lircd.

.SH OPTIONS
The \-\-permission option gives the file permission of
\/var/run/lirc/lircd if it has to be created in octal
representation. Read the documentation for chmod for further
details. If no \-\-permission option is given when the socket is
initially created the default is to give all users read and write
permissions (0666 in octal representation). If /var/run/lirc/lircd
already exists this option has no effect.

With the \-\-device option you can select the character device which
lircd should read from. The default currently is /dev/lirc but it
probably will change in future.

If you're using the dev/input driver, you can use \fIname=STRING\fR or
\fIphys=STRING\fR to select the device; lircd will look in /dev/input
to find a device with a matching description. This is useful in case
the device name isn't fixed. \fISTRING\fR may contain the '*' and '?' 
wildcards and '\\' to mark them as literal.

With the \-\-listen option you can let lircd listen for network
connections on the given address/port. The default address is 0.0.0.0,
which means that connections on all network interfaces will be accepted.
The default port is 8765. No security checks are currently implemented.
The listening lircd instance will send all IR events to the connecting
lircd instances.

The \-\-connect option allows you to connect to other lircd servers that
provide a network socket at the given host and port number. The number
of such connections is currently limited to 100.
The connecting lircd instance will receive IR events from the lircd
instance it connects to.

With the \-\-output option you can select Unix domain socket, which
lircd will write remote key codes to. The default currently is
\/var/run/lirc/lircd.

With the \-\-pidfile option you can select the lircd daemon pid file.
The default currently is /var/run/lirc/lircd.pid.

With the \-\-logfile option you can select the lircd daemon log file.
The default currently is /var/log/lircd. Note that this option will
only be available if you compiled lircd without syslog support.

The \-\-release option enables automatic generation of release events
for each button press. lircd will append the given suffix to the button
name for each release event. If no suffix is given the default suffix
is '_UP'.

The \-\-allow\-simulate option will enable the SIMULATE command which can
be issued using irsend(1). This will allow simulating arbitrary IR events
from the command line. Use this option with caution because it will give all
users with access to the lircd socket wide control over you system.
E.g. if you have configured your system to shut down by a button press
on your remote control, everybody will be able to shut down
your system from the command line.

On Linux systems the \-\-uinput option will enable automatic generation
of Linux input events. lircd will open /dev/input/uinput and inject
key events to the Linux kernel. The key code depends on the name that
was given a button in the lircd config file, e.g. if the button is
named KEY_1, the '1' key code will be generated. You will find a
complete list of possible button names in /usr/include/linux/input.h.

The --repeat-max option sets an upper limit to the number of repeats
when sending a signal. The current default is 600. A SEND_START
request will repeat the signal this many times. Also, if the number of
repeats in a SEND_ONCE request exceeds this number, it will be
replaced by this number.
.SH FILES

The config file for lircd is located in /etc/lirc/lircd.conf. lircd
has its own log file in /var/log/lircd (beginning with LIRC version
0.6.1 you can configure lircd to use syslogd for log messages; then it
depends on your system configuration where log messages will show up).
You can make lircd reread its config file and reopen its log file by
sending the HUP signal to the program. That way you can rotate old log
files.
.SH DAEMONS
lircd and lircmd are daemons. You should start them in some init script
depending on your system. There are some example scripts for different
distributions in the contrib directory. lircmd has to be started after
lircd as it connects to the socket lircd provides.

If you start lircd or lircmd from your shell prompt you will usually get
back immediately to the prompt. Often people think that the program has
died. But this is not an error. lircd and lircmd are daemons. Daemons
always run in background.

.B lirc
is maintained as html pages. They are located under html/ in the
documentation directory.
